# 🌸 Hey there, welcome to my space!  

I’m on a journey to grow as a **Data Analyst** — exploring data, uncovering insights, and bringing them to life through dashboards.  
Here you’ll discover:  

📊 Projects where I analyze and visualize data in creative ways  
🧩 Skills I’m building with SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI  
🚀 My progress from beginner projects to industry-ready work  

I believe every dataset has a story — and I’m here to tell it.
